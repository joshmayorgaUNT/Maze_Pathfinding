TO-DO: Need to implement dijkstra pathfinding algorithm
	This function must have the following features
	(!!! = highest priority, !! = high priority, ! = low priority) 

	!!! function should return the distance of the shortest path
	!!  need to somehow show the amount of time it takes to calculate this
	!!  figure out big-O complexity
	!   somehow return a list of the shortest path
	!   display the pathfinding algorithm as it works (very low priority)
