TO-DO: Need to implement A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm
        This function must have the following features
        (!!! = highest priority, !! = high priority, ! = low priority) 

        !!! function should return the distance of the shortest path
        !!  need to somehow show the amount of time it takes to calculate this
	!!  figure out Big-O complexity
        !   somehow return a list of the shortest path
        !   display the pathfinding algorithm as it works (very low priority)
